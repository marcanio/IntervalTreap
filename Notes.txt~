Overview~

>Interval database: A dynamic set of elements with each element containing an
interval (x.interv).
	-IntervalInsert(x): Adds X with refrence to X.interv
	-IntervalDelete(x): Remove X
	-IntervalSearch(i): Returns ref. to X where X.interv overlaps interv i
------------
Data Structure~

>Object i: An interval [a,b] with attributes i.low (Low endpoint) & i.high.
	-Interval Trichotomy(overlap): If the interaction of the two objects!=null 
>Fact: Any two intervals satisfy exactly ONE of the three
	-Overlap
	-One is smaller
	-One is larger
>Inorder tree walk: Intervals sorted by low end point
>Interval Search: Finds an overlapping interval. Always Checks left tree
	-If (X.left != null && x.left.imax >= i.low) LEFT
	-If (x.left.imax < i.low) RIGHT
